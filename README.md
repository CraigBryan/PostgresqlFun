PostgresqlFun
============

CSI3130 Project

The build and test script runs now. Run testsuite-CSI3130/go.sh to make it happen. It builds postgresql, installs it, creates a database cluster, starts the server, creates a database, runs testcase_sql.sql, then runs the check  results ruby script, and then cleans up.
