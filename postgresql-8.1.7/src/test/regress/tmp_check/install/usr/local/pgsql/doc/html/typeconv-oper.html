that category is selected, and then the 
preferred type for strings, <TT

>The <SPAN

entries for the prefix operator <TT

absolute-value operations for various numeric data types.  One of these
entries is for type <TT

the numeric category.  Therefore, <SPAN

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

><P>
Here the system has performed an implicit conversion from <TT

CLASS="TYPE"
>float8</TT

before applying the chosen operator.  We can verify that <TT
CLASS="TYPE"

not some other type was used:

CLASS="SCREEN"

>On the other hand, the prefix operator <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

try a similar case with <TT

</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>SELECT ~ '20' AS "negation";

ERROR:  operator is not unique: ~ "unknown"
HINT:  Could not choose a best candidate operator. You may need to add explicit
type casts.</PRE
><P>
This happens because the system can't decide which of the several
possible <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>~</TT

it out with an explicit cast:
</P><PRE
