      (mainly because <TT

      also need to shut down the server before restoring the data.

>      If you have dug into the details of the file system layout of the
      database, you may be tempted to try to back up or restore only certain
      individual tables or databases from their respective files or
      directories. This will <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"

      information contained in these files contains only half the
      truth. The other half is in the commit log files
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog/*</TT
>, which contain the commit status of
      all transactions. A table file is only usable with this
      information. Of course it is also impossible to restore only a
      table and the associated <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_clog</TT
> data
      because that would render all other tables in the database
      cluster useless.  So file system backups only work for complete
      restoration of an entire database cluster.

>   An alternative file-system backup approach is to make a
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"consistent snapshot"</SPAN
> of the data directory, if the
   file system supports that functionality (and you are willing to
   trust that it is implemented correctly).  The typical procedure is
   to make a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frozen snapshot"</SPAN
> of the volume containing the
   database, then copy the whole data directory (not just parts, see
   above) from the snapshot to a backup device, then release the frozen
   snapshot.  This will work even while the database server is running.
   However, a backup created in this way saves
   the database files in a state where the database server was not
   properly shut down; therefore, when you start the database server
   on the backed-up data, it will think the server had crashed
   and replay the WAL log.  This is not a problem, just be aware of
   it (and be sure to include the WAL files in your backup).
  </P
><P
>   If your database is spread across multiple file systems, there may not 
   be any way to obtain exactly-simultaneous frozen snapshots of all 
   the volumes.  For example, if your data files and WAL log are on different
   disks, or if tablespaces are on different file systems, it might
   not be possible to use snapshot backup because the snapshots must be
   simultaneous.
   Read your file system documentation very carefully before trusting
   to the consistent-snapshot technique in such situations.  The safest
   approach is to shut down the database server for long enough to
   establish all the frozen snapshots.
  </P
><P
>   Another option is to use <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>rsync</SPAN
> to perform a file
   system backup.  This is done by first running <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>rsync</SPAN
>
   while the database server is running, then shutting down the database
   server just long enough to do a second <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>rsync</SPAN
>.  The
   second <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>rsync</SPAN
> will be much quicker than the first,
   because it has relatively little data to transfer, and the end result
   will be consistent because the server was down.  This method
   allows a file system backup to be performed with minimal downtime.
  </P
><P
>   Note that a file system backup will not necessarily be
   smaller than an SQL dump. On the contrary, it will most likely be
   larger. (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>pg_dump</SPAN

   the contents of indexes for example, just the commands to recreate
   them.)
