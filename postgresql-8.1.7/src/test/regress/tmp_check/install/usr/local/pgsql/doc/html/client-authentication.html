>   Files included by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>@</TT

   which can be separated by either whitespace or commas.  Comments are
   introduced by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>#</TT
>, just as in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
>, and nested <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>@</TT
> constructs are
   allowed.  Unless the file name following <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>@</TT
> is an absolute
   path, it is taken to be relative to the directory containing the
   referencing file.
  </P
><P
>   Since the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_hba.conf</TT
> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is
   significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection
   match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later
   records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication
   methods. For example, one might wish to use <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>trust</TT
>
   authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for
   remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>trust</TT
> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.

>   The <TT

   signal. If you edit the file on an

>postmaster</TT

   (using <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_ctl reload</TT
