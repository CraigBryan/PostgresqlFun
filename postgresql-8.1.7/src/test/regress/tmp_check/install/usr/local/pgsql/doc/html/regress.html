>   The regression tests can be run against an already installed and
   running server, or using a temporary installation within the build
   tree.  Furthermore, there is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"parallel"</SPAN
> and a
   <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sequential"</SPAN
> mode for running the tests.  The
   sequential method runs each test script in turn, whereas the
   parallel method starts up multiple server processes to run groups
   of tests in parallel.  Parallel testing gives confidence that
   interprocess communication and locking are working correctly.  For
   historical reasons, the sequential test is usually run against an
   existing installation and the parallel method against a temporary
   installation, but there are no technical reasons for this.

   in the top-level directory.  (Or you can change to
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/test/regress</TT
> and run the command there.)
   This will first build several auxiliary files, such as
   some sample user-defined trigger functions, and then run the test driver
   script.  At the end you should see something like
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>======================

   or otherwise a note about which tests failed.  See <A

   <SPAN

  </P
><P
>    Because this test method runs a temporary server, it will not work
    when you are the root user (since the server will not start as root).
    If you already did the build as root, you do not have to start all
    over.  Instead, make the regression test directory writable by
    some other user, log in as that user, and restart the tests.
    For example
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
><SAMP
CLASS="PROMPT"
>root# </SAMP
><KBD
CLASS="USERINPUT"
>chmod -R a+w src/test/regress</KBD

>    If you have configured <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    into a location where an older <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>
    installation already exists, and you perform <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gmake check</TT
>
    before installing the new version, you may find that the tests fail
    because the new programs try to use the already-installed shared
    libraries.  (Typical symptoms are complaints about undefined symbols.)
    If you wish to run the tests before overwriting the old installation,
    you'll need to build with <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>configure --disable-rpath</TT
>.
    It is not recommended that you use this option for the final installation,
    however.
   </P

>    The parallel regression test starts quite a few processes under your
    user ID.  Presently, the maximum concurrency is twenty parallel test
    scripts, which means sixty processes: there's a server process, a
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>, and usually a shell parent process for the
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
> for each test script.
    So if your system enforces a per-user limit on the number of processes,
    make sure this limit is at least seventy-five or so, else you may get
    random-seeming failures in the parallel test.  If you are not in
    a position to raise the limit, you can cut down the degree of parallelism
    by setting the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>MAX_CONNECTIONS</TT
> parameter.  For example,
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake MAX_CONNECTIONS=10 check</PRE
><P>
    runs no more than ten tests concurrently.
   </P
><P
>    On some systems, the default Bourne-compatible shell
    (<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/bin/sh</TT
>) gets confused when it has to manage
    too many child processes in parallel.  This may cause the parallel
    test run to lock up or fail.  In such cases, specify a different
    Bourne-compatible shell on the command line, for example:
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake SHELL=/bin/ksh check</PRE
><P>
    If no non-broken shell is available, you may be able to work around the
    problem by limiting the number of connections, as shown above.
   </P

>   To run the tests after installation (see <A
HREF="installation.html"
>Chapter 14</A
>),
   initialize a data area and start the
   server, as explained in <A
HREF="runtime.html"
>Chapter 16</A
>,  then type
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
or for a parallel test
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck-parallel</PRE
><P>
   The tests will expect to contact the server at the local host and the
   default port number, unless directed otherwise by <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGHOST</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PGPORT</TT
> environment variables.
  </P
><P
>   The source distribution also contains regression tests for the optional
   procedural languages and for some of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules.
   At present, these tests can be used only against an already-installed
   server.  To run the tests for all procedural languages that have been
   built and installed, change to the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/pl</TT
> directory of the
   build tree and type
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
   You can also do this in any of the subdirectories of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>src/pl</TT
>
   to run tests for just one procedural language.  To run the tests for all
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules that have them, change to the
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> directory of the build tree and type
</P><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>gmake installcheck</PRE
><P>
   The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> modules must have been built and installed first.
   You can also do this in a subdirectory of <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>contrib</TT
> to run
   the tests for just one module.
