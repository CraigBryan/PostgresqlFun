><P
>    Partitioning refers to splitting what is logically one large table
    into smaller physical pieces.
    Partitioning can provide several benefits:
   <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>      Query performance can be improved dramatically for certain kinds
      of queries.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Update performance can be improved too, since each piece of the table
      has indexes smaller than an index on the entire data set would be.
      When an index no longer fits easily
      in memory, both read and write operations on the index take
      progressively more disk accesses.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Bulk deletes may be accomplished by simply removing one of the
      partitions, if that requirement is planned into the partitioning design.
      <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP TABLE</TT
> is far faster than a bulk <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
>,
      to say nothing of the ensuing <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> overhead.
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>      Seldom-used data can be migrated to cheaper and slower storage media.
     </P
></LI
></UL
><P>

    The benefits will normally be worthwhile only when a table would
    otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will
    benefit from partitioning depends on the application, although a
    rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical
    memory of the database server.
   </P
><P
>    Currently, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> supports partitioning
    via table inheritance.  Each partition must be created as a child
    table of a single parent table.  The parent table itself is normally
    empty; it exists just to represent the entire data set.  You should be
    familiar with inheritance (see <A
HREF="ddl-inherit.html"
>Section 5.8</A
>) before
    attempting to implement partitioning.

     ice cream company. The company measures peak temperatures every
     day as well as ice cream sales in each region. Conceptually,
     we want a table like this:

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

    city_id         int not null,
    logdate         date not null,
    peaktemp        int,
    unitsales       int
);</PRE

     We know that most queries will access just the last week's, month's or
     quarter's data, since the main use of this table will be to prepare
     online reports for management.
     To reduce the amount of old data that needs to be stored, we
     decide to only keep the most recent 3 years worth of data. At the
     beginning of each month we will remove the oldest month's data.
    </P
><P
>     In this situation we can use partitioning to help us meet all of our
     different requirements for the measurements table. Following the
     steps outlined above, partitioning can be set up as follows:

    Some or all of the partitions might use index scans instead of
    full-table sequential scans, but the point here is that there
    is no need to scan the older partitions at all to answer this query.
    When we enable constraint exclusion, we get a significantly
    reduced plan that will deliver the same answer:

      clause contains constants.  A parameterized query will not be
      optimized, since the planner cannot know what partitions the
      parameter value might select at runtime.  For the same reason,
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"stable"</SPAN
> functions such as <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>CURRENT_DATE</CODE
>
      must be avoided.  Joining the partition key to a column of another
      table will not be optimized, either.

>      Avoid cross-datatype comparisons in the <TT

      constraints, as the planner will currently fail to prove such
      conditions false.  For example, the following constraint
      will work if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>x</TT
> is an <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>integer</TT
>
      column, but not if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>x</TT
> is a
      <TT

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CHECK ( x = 1 )</PRE
><P>
      For a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> column we must use a constraint like:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CHECK ( x = 1::bigint )</PRE
><P>
      The problem is not limited to the <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>bigint</TT
> data type
      &mdash; it can occur whenever the default data type of the
      constant does not match the data type of the column to which it
      is being compared.  Cross-datatype comparisons in the supplied
      queries are usually OK, just not in the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CHECK</TT
> conditions.
