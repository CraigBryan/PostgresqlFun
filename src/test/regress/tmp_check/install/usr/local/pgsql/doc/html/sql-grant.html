><H2
>Description</H2
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GRANT</TT
> command has two basic variants: one
   that grants privileges on a database object (table, view, sequence,
   database, function, procedural language, schema, or tablespace),
   and one that grants membership in a role.  These variants are
   similar in many ways, but they are different enough to be described
   separately.
  </P
><P
>   As of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 8.1, the concepts of users and
   groups have been unified into a single kind of entity called a role.
   It is therefore no longer necessary to use the keyword <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>GROUP</TT
>
   to identify whether a grantee is a user or a group.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>GROUP</TT
>
   is still allowed in the command, but it is a noise word.
  </P
><DIV

NAME="SQL-GRANT-DESCRIPTION-OBJECTS"
></A
><H3
>GRANT on Database Objects</H3
><P
>   This variant of the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GRANT</TT
> command gives specific
   privileges on a database object to
   one or more roles.  These privileges are added
   to those already granted, if any.
  </P
><P
>   The key word <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> indicates that the
   privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that may
   be created later.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
> may be thought of as an
   implicitly defined group that always includes all roles.
   Any particular role will have the sum
   of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it
   is presently a member of, and privileges granted to
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   If <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>WITH GRANT OPTION</TT
> is specified, the recipient
   of the privilege may in turn grant it to others.  Without a grant
   option, the recipient cannot do that.  Grant options cannot be granted
   to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object
   (usually the user that created it),
   as the owner has all privileges by default.  (The owner could,
   however, choose to revoke some of his own privileges for safety.)
   The right to drop an object, or to alter its definition in any way is
   not described by a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner,
   and cannot be granted or revoked.  The owner implicitly has all grant
   options for the object, too.
  </P
><P
>   Depending on the type of object, the initial default privileges may
   include granting some privileges to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PUBLIC</TT
>.
   The default is no public access for tables, schemas, and tablespaces;
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TEMP</TT
> table creation privilege for databases;
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>EXECUTE</TT
> privilege for functions; and
   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>USAGE</TT
> privilege for languages.
   The object owner may of course revoke these privileges.  (For maximum
   security, issue the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>REVOKE</TT
> in the same transaction that
   creates the object; then there is no window in which another user
   may use the object.)
