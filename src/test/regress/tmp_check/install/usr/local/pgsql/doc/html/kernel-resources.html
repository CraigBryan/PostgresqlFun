    <A
HREF="kernel-resources.html#SHARED-MEMORY-PARAMETERS"

    You can, as a temporary solution, lower some of those settings to
    avoid the failure.  As a rough approximation, you can estimate the
    required segment size as 500 kB plus the variable amounts shown in
    the table.  (Any error message you might get will include the exact
    size of the failed allocation request.)  While it is possible to get
    <SPAN

CLASS="VARNAME"
>SHMMAX</TT

    1 MB, you need at least 4 MB for acceptable performance, and desirable

   </P
><P

    approximately 500 kB for <SPAN

    (<TT

    also contain a 17th semaphore which contains a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    determines the limit on the number of semaphore sets that can
    exist on the system at one time.  Hence this parameter must be at
    least <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

    resource map, in which each contiguous block of available semaphores
    needs an entry. When a semaphore set is freed it is either added to
    an existing entry that is adjacent to the freed block or it is
    registered under a new map entry. If the map is full, the freed
    semaphores get lost (until reboot). Fragmentation of the semaphore
    space could over time lead to fewer available semaphores than there
    should be.

         mind that shared memory is not pageable; it is locked in RAM.
         To increase the amount of shared memory supported by your

         the maximum shared memory area to 32 MB.

         <TT

    but it can be changed by the user up to the hard limit. The hard
    limit can only be changed by the root user. The system call
