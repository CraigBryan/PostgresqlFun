   <I

   every change made to the database's data files.  This log exists
   primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the
   database can be restored to consistency by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   log entries made since the last checkpoint.  However, the existence
   of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up
   databases: we can combine a file-system-level backup with backup of
   the WAL files.  If recovery is needed, we restore the backup and
   then replay from the backed-up WAL files to bring the backup up to
   current time.  This approach is more complex to administer than
   either of the previous approaches, but it has some significant
   benefits:
  <P
></P

><LI
><P
>     We do not need a perfectly consistent backup as the starting point.
     Any internal inconsistency in the backup will be corrected by log
     replay (this is not significantly different from what happens during
     crash recovery).  So we don't need file system snapshot capability,
     just <SPAN

    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Since we can string together an indefinitely long sequence of WAL files

     the WAL files.  This is particularly valuable for large databases, where
     it may not be convenient to take a full backup frequently.
    </P

><P
>     There is nothing that says we have to replay the WAL entries all the

   Also, it requires a lot of archival storage: the base backup may be bulky,
   and a busy system will generate many megabytes of WAL traffic that
   have to be archived.  Still, it is the preferred backup technique in
   many situations where high reliability is needed.

    produces an indefinitely long sequence of WAL records.  The system
    physically divides this sequence into WAL <I

    altered when building <SPAN

    provide the database administrator with as much flexibility as possible,

   </P
><P

    any pre-existing archive file.  This is an important safety feature to
    preserve the integrity of your archive in case of administrator error
    (such as sending the output of two different servers to the same archive
    directory).
    It is advisable to test your proposed archive command to ensure that it
    indeed does not overwrite an existing file, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"

CLASS="EMPHASIS"

    nonzero status in this case</I

    this correctly on some platforms but not others.  If the chosen command
    does not itself handle this case correctly, you should add a command
    to test for pre-existence of the archive file.  For example, something
    like
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>archive_command = 'test ! -f .../%f &amp;&amp; cp %p .../%f'</PRE
><P>
    works correctly on most Unix variants.
   </P
><P
>    While designing your archiving setup, consider what will happen if
    the archive command fails repeatedly because some aspect requires 
    operator intervention or the archive runs out of space. For example, this
    could occur if you write to tape without an autochanger; when the tape 
    fills, nothing further can be archived until the tape is swapped.
    You should ensure that any error condition or request to a human operator
    is reported appropriately so that the situation can be 
    resolved relatively quickly. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will
    continue to fill with WAL segment files until the situation is resolved.
   </P
><P
>    The speed of the archiving command is not important, so long as it can keep up
    with the average rate at which your server generates WAL data.  Normal
    operation continues even if the archiving process falls a little behind.
    If archiving falls significantly behind, this will increase the amount of
    data that would be lost in the event of a disaster. It will also mean that
    the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog/</TT
> directory will contain large numbers of
    not-yet-archived segment files, which could eventually exceed available
    disk space. You are advised to monitor the archiving process to ensure that
    it is working as you intend.
   </P
><P
>    If you are concerned about being able to recover right up to the
    current instant, you may want to take additional steps to ensure that
    the current, partially-filled WAL segment is also copied someplace.
    This is particularly important if your server generates only little WAL
    traffic (or has slack periods where it does so), since it could take a
    long time before a WAL segment file is completely filled and ready to
    archive.  One possible way to handle this is to set up a
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>cron</SPAN
> job that periodically (once a minute, perhaps)
    identifies the current WAL segment file and saves it someplace safe.
    Then the combination of the archived WAL segments and the saved current
    segment will be enough to ensure you can always restore to within a
    minute of current time.  This behavior is not presently built into
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    definition of the <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND"

    to keep track of successively archived, but different, copies of the
    same WAL file.  The <A
HREF="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-COMMAND"

    invoked on completed WAL segments. Except in the case of retrying a
    failure, it will be called only once for any given file name.
   </P
><P
>    In writing your archive command, you should assume that the file names to
    be archived may be up to 64 characters long and may contain any
    combination of ASCII letters, digits, and dots.  It is not necessary to
    remember the original full path (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>%p</TT

    remember the file name (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   </P
><P

    This situation is normal, and not an error, when taking a base backup of
    an active database; so you need to ensure that you can distinguish
    complaints of this sort from real errors.  For example, some versions
    of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>rsync</SPAN
> return a separate exit code for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"vanished
    source files"</SPAN
>, and you can write a driver script to accept this exit
    code as a non-error case.  Also,
    some versions of GNU <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN

    is changed while <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

> is copying it.  There does not seem
    to be any very convenient way to distinguish this error from other types
    of errors, other than manual inspection of <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN
>'s messages.
    GNU <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN
> is therefore not the best tool for making base
    backups.
   </P
><P

    nor between the end of the backup and <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE

    few minutes' delay won't hurt anything.  You
    must however be quite sure that these operations are carried out in
    sequence and do not overlap.
   </P
><P
>    Be certain that your backup dump includes all of the files underneath
    the database cluster directory (e.g., <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/local/pgsql/data</TT

    If you are using tablespaces that do not reside underneath this directory,
    be careful to include them as well (and be sure that your backup dump
    archives symbolic links as links, otherwise the restore will mess up
    your tablespaces).
   </P

    of mistakes when restoring.  This is easy to arrange if

    reasons.
   </P
><P
>    To make use of this backup, you will need to keep around all the WAL
    segment files generated during and after the file system backup.
    To aid you in doing this, the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE
> function
    creates a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>backup history file</I
> that is immediately
    stored into the WAL archive area. This file is named after the first
    WAL segment file that you need to have to make use of the backup.
    For example, if the starting WAL file is
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD</TT
> the backup history file will be
    named something like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup</TT
>. (The second
    number in the file name stands for an exact position within the WAL
    file, and can ordinarily be ignored.) Once you have safely archived
    the file system backup and the WAL segment files used during the
    backup (as specified in the backup history file), all archived WAL
    segments with names numerically less are no longer needed to recover
    the file system backup and may be deleted. However, you should
    consider keeping several backup sets to be absolutely certain that
    you can recover your data. Keep in mind that only completed WAL
    segment files are archived, so there will be delay between running
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE
> and the archiving of all WAL segment
    files needed to make the file system backup consistent.
   </P
><P
>    The backup history file is just a small text file. It contains the
    label string you gave to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_start_backup</CODE
>, as well as
    the starting and ending times and WAL segments of the backup.
    If you used the label to identify where the associated dump file is kept, 
    then the archived history file is enough to tell you which dump file to
    restore, should you need to do so.
   </P
><P
>    Since you have to keep around all the archived WAL files back to your
    last base backup, the interval between base backups should usually be
    chosen based on how much storage you want to expend on archived WAL
    files.  You should also consider how long you are prepared to spend
    recovering, if recovery should be necessary &mdash; the system will have to
    replay all those WAL segments, and that could take awhile if it has
    been a long time since the last base backup.
   </P
><P
>    It's also worth noting that the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"

    directory, which is then removed again by <CODE

    (If recovery proceeds all the way to the end of WAL, however, we do not
    start a new timeline: we just extend the existing one.)  The timeline
    ID number is part of WAL segment file names, and so a new timeline does
    not overwrite the WAL data generated by previous timelines.  It is
    in fact possible to archive many different timelines.  While that might
    seem like a useless feature, it's often a lifesaver.  Consider the
    situation where you aren't quite sure what point-in-time to recover to,
    and so have to do several point-in-time recoveries by trial and error
    until you find the best place to branch off from the old history.  Without
    timelines this process would soon generate an unmanageable mess.  With
    timelines, you can recover to <SPAN

    to pick the right WAL segment files when recovering from an archive that
    contains multiple timelines.  Therefore, they are archived into the WAL
    archive area just like WAL segment files.  The history files are just
    small text files, so it's cheap and appropriate to keep them around
    indefinitely (unlike the segment files which are large).  You can, if
    you like, add comments to a history file to make your own notes about
    how and why this particular timeline came to be.  Such comments will be
    especially valuable when you have a thicket of different timelines as
    a result of experimentation.

    These page snapshots are designed to support crash recovery,
    since we may need to fix partially-written disk pages.  Depending
    on your system hardware and software, the risk of partial writes may
    be small enough to ignore, in which case you can significantly reduce
    the total volume of archived logs by turning off page snapshots

    Turning off page snapshots does not prevent use of the logs for PITR
    operations.
    An area for future development is to compress archived WAL data by
    removing unnecessary page copies even when <TT
