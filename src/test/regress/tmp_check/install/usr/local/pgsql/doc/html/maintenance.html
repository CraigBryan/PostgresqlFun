   in nature and can easily be automated using standard Unix tools such
   as <SPAN

   administrator's responsibility to set up appropriate scripts, and to
   check that they execute successfully.
  </P

>   One obvious maintenance task is creation of backup copies of the data on a
   regular schedule.  Without a recent backup, you have no chance of recovery
   after a catastrophe (disk failure, fire, mistakenly dropping a critical
   table, etc.).  The backup and recovery mechanisms available in
   <SPAN

   The frequency and scope of the <TT

   understand these issues and develop an appropriate maintenance

   issues; for details about command syntax and so on, see the <A

   Routine vacuuming is therefore not nearly as intrusive as it was in prior

    This approach is necessary to gain the benefits of multiversion
    concurrency control (see <A
HREF="mvcc.html"
>Chapter 12</A
>): the row version
    must not be deleted while it is still potentially visible to other
    transactions. But eventually, an outdated or deleted row version is no
    longer of interest to any transaction. The space it occupies must be
    reclaimed for reuse by new rows, to avoid infinite growth of disk
    space requirements. This is done by running <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

   </P
><P

    to be vacuumed more often than tables that are seldom updated. It
    may be useful to set up periodic <SPAN

    large heavily-updated tables and large seldom-updated tables &mdash; the
    extra cost of vacuuming a small table isn't enough to be worth
    worrying about.
   </P
><P

    command. The first form, known as <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    just <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    indexes for future reuse; it does <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>not</I
></SPAN
> attempt
    to reclaim the space used by this expired data unless the space is
    at the end of the table and an exclusive table lock can be easily 
    obtained. Unused space at the start or middle of the file does
    not result in the file being shortened and space returned to the
    operating system. This variant of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> can be
    run concurrently with normal database operations.
   </P
><P
>    The second form is the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
>
    command. This uses a more aggressive algorithm for reclaiming the
    space consumed by expired row versions. Any space that is freed by
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> is immediately returned to the
    operating system. Unfortunately, this variant of the
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    each table while <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    it. Therefore, frequently using <TT

    have an extremely negative effect on the performance of concurrent
    database queries.
   </P
><P
>    The standard form of <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    of maintaining a fairly level steady-state usage of disk space. If
    you need to return disk space to the operating system you can use
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> &mdash; but what's the point of releasing disk
    space that will only have to be allocated again soon?  Moderately
    frequent standard <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    than infrequent <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FULL</TT
> runs for maintaining
    heavily-updated tables.
   </P
><P
>    Recommended practice for most sites is to schedule a database-wide
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> once a day at a low-usage time of day,
    supplemented by more frequent vacuuming of heavily-updated tables
    if necessary. (Some installations with an extremely high
    rate of data modification <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    often as once every few minutes.)  If you have multiple databases

   </P
><P
>    As with vacuuming for space recovery, frequent updates of statistics
    are more useful for heavily-updated tables than for seldom-updated
    ones. But even for a heavily-updated table, there may be no need for
    statistics updates if the statistical distribution of the data is
    not changing much. A simple rule of thumb is to think about how much
    the minimum and maximum values of the columns in the table change.
    For example, a <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>timestamp</TT
> column that contains the time
    of row update will have a constantly-increasing maximum value as
    rows are added and updated; such a column will probably need more
    frequent statistics updates than, say, a column containing URLs for
    pages accessed on a website. The URL column may receive changes just
    as often, but the statistical distribution of its values probably
    changes relatively slowly.
   </P

    just specific columns of a table, so the flexibility exists to update some
    statistics more frequently than others if your application requires it.
    In practice, however, the usefulness of this feature is doubtful.
    Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 7.2,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> is a fairly fast operation even on large tables,
    because it uses a statistical random sampling of the rows of a table
    rather than reading every single row.  So it's probably much simpler
    to just run it over the whole database every so often.

    transaction's XID is <SPAN

    wraparound</I
>: the XID counter wraps around to zero, and all of a sudden
    transactions that were in the past appear to be in the future &mdash; which

    (Actually the data is still there, but that's cold comfort if you can't
    get at it.)
   </P
><P
>    Prior to <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    against XID wraparound was to re-<TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> at least every 4
    billion transactions. This of course was not very satisfactory for
    high-traffic sites, so a better solution has been devised. The new
    approach allows a server to remain up indefinitely, without
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT
> or any sort of restart. The price is this
    maintenance requirement: <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>every table in the database must
    be vacuumed at least once every billion transactions</I
></SPAN
>.
   </P
><P
>    In practice this isn't an onerous requirement, but since the
    consequences of failing to meet it can be complete data loss (not
    just wasted disk space or slow performance), some special provisions
    have been made to help database administrators avoid disaster.
    For each database in the cluster, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

    keeps track of the time of the last database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    When any database approaches the billion-transaction danger level,
    the system begins to emit warning messages.  If nothing is done, it
    will eventually shut down normal operations until appropriate
    manual maintenance is done.  The remainder of this
    section gives the details.
   </P
><P
>    The new approach to XID comparison distinguishes two special XIDs,
    numbers 1 and 2 (<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>BootstrapXID</TT
> and
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
>). These two XIDs are always considered older
    than every normal XID. Normal XIDs (those greater than 2) are
    compared using modulo-2<SUP
>31</SUP

    that for every normal XID, there are two billion XIDs that are
    <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"older"</SPAN
> and two billion that are <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"newer"</SPAN
>; another
    way to say it is that the normal XID space is circular with no
    endpoint. Therefore, once a row version has been created with a particular
    normal XID, the row version will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> for
    the next two billion transactions, no matter which normal XID we are
    talking about. If the row version still exists after more than two billion
    transactions, it will suddenly appear to be in the future. To
    prevent data loss, old row versions must be reassigned the XID
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
> sometime before they reach the
    two-billion-transactions-old mark. Once they are assigned this
    special XID, they will appear to be <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"in the past"</SPAN
> to all
    normal transactions regardless of wraparound issues, and so such
    row versions will be good until deleted, no matter how long that is. This
    reassignment of XID is handled by <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT
>
    to any row version with a normal XID more than one billion transactions in the
    past.  This policy preserves the original insertion XID until it is not
    likely to be of interest anymore.  (In fact, most row versions will probably
    live and die without ever being <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"frozen"</SPAN
>.)  With this policy,
    the maximum safe interval between <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> runs on any table
    is exactly one billion transactions: if you wait longer, it's possible
    that a row version that was not quite old enough to be reassigned last time
    is now more than two billion transactions old and has wrapped around
    into the future &mdash; i.e., is lost to you.  (Of course, it'll reappear
    after another two billion transactions, but that's no help.)
   </P
><P
>    Since periodic <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT

    described earlier, it's unlikely that any table would not be vacuumed
    for as long as a billion transactions.  But to help administrators ensure
    this constraint is met, <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> stores transaction ID
    statistics in the system table <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_database</TT
>.  In particular,
    the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>datfrozenxid</TT

    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_database</TT

    database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> operation (i.e.,
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> that does not
    name a specific table).  The value stored in this field is the freeze
    cutoff XID that was used by that <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> command.  All normal
    XIDs older than this cutoff XID are guaranteed to have been replaced by
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>FrozenXID</TT

    examine this information is to execute the query

</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

><P>

    The <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"

   </P
><P
>    With the standard freezing policy, the <TT

    at one billion for a freshly-vacuumed database.  When the <TT

    database at least once every half-a-billion (500 million) transactions,
    so as to provide plenty of safety margin.  To help meet this rule,

    The 1-million-transaction safety margin exists to let the

    execute commands once it has gone into the safety shutdown mode,
    the only way to do this is to stop the postmaster and use a standalone
    backend to execute <TT

    by a standalone backend.  See the <A

    aggressive freezing policy: row versions are frozen if they are old enough
    to be considered good by all open transactions. In particular, if a
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM FREEZE</TT

    database, it is guaranteed that <SPAN

    database will be frozen. Hence, as long as the database is not
    modified in any way, it will not need subsequent vacuuming to avoid
    transaction ID wraparound problems. This technique is used by
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>initdb</TT

    It should also be used to prepare any user-created databases that

    <TT

></H2
><A
NAME="AEN23125"
></A
><P
>    Beginning in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL </SPAN
> 8.1, there is a
    separate optional server process called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>autovacuum
    daemon</I
>, whose purpose is to automate the execution of
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE </TT
> commands.
    When enabled, the autovacuum daemon runs periodically and checks for
    tables that have had a large number of inserted, updated or deleted
    tuples.  These checks use the row-level statistics collection facility;
    therefore, the autovacuum daemon cannot be used unless <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-STATS-START-COLLECTOR"
>stats_start_collector</A
> and <A
HREF="runtime-config-statistics.html#GUC-STATS-ROW-LEVEL"
>stats_row_level</A
> are set to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>true</TT
>.  Also,
    it's important to allow a slot for the autovacuum process when choosing
    the value of <A
HREF="runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SUPERUSER-RESERVED-CONNECTIONS"
>superuser_reserved_connections</A
>.
   </P
><P
>    The autovacuum daemon, when enabled, runs every <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-NAPTIME"
>autovacuum_naptime</A
> seconds and determines which database
    to process.  Any database which is close to transaction ID wraparound
    is immediately processed.  In this case, autovacuum issues a
    database-wide <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> call, or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM
    FREEZE</TT
> if it's a template database, and then terminates.  If
    no database fulfills this criterion, the one that was least recently
    processed by autovacuum is chosen.  In this case each table in
    the selected database is checked, and individual <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
>
    or <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> commands are issued as needed.
   </P
><P
>    For each table, two conditions are used to determine which operation(s)
    to apply.  If the number of obsolete tuples since the last
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>VACUUM</TT
> exceeds the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"vacuum threshold"</SPAN
>, the
    table is vacuumed.  The vacuum threshold is defined as:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>vacuum threshold = vacuum base threshold + vacuum scale factor * number of tuples</PRE
><P>
    where the vacuum base threshold is
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-VACUUM-THRESHOLD"
>autovacuum_vacuum_threshold</A
>,
    the vacuum scale factor is
    <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-VACUUM-SCALE-FACTOR"
>autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor</A
>,
    and the number of tuples is
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_class</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>reltuples</TT
>.
    The number of obsolete tuples is obtained from the statistics
    collector; it is a semi-accurate count updated by each
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT
> operation.  (It
    is only semi-accurate because some information may be lost under heavy
    load.)  For analyze, a similar condition is used: the threshold, defined as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>analyze threshold = analyze base threshold + analyze scale factor * number of tuples</PRE
><P>
    is compared to the total number of tuples inserted, updated, or deleted
    since the last <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
>.
   </P
><P
>    The default thresholds and scale factors are taken from
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"

    on a table-by-table basis by making entries in the system catalog
    <A
HREF="catalog-pg-autovacuum.html"
><TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
></A
>.
    If a <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT

    table, the settings it specifies are applied; otherwise the global
    settings are used.  See <A
HREF="runtime-config-autovacuum.html"
>Section 17.9</A
> for
    more details on the global settings.
   </P
><P
>    Besides the base threshold values and scale factors, there are three
    more parameters that can be set for each table in
    <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT

    The first, <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT
>.<TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>enabled</TT
>,
    can be set to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>false</TT

    to skip that particular table entirely.  In this case
    autovacuum will only touch the table when it vacuums the entire database
    to prevent transaction ID wraparound.
    The other two parameters, the vacuum cost delay
    (<TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_autovacuum</TT

    and the vacuum cost limit
    (<TT
