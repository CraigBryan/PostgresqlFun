    default installation simply enter

    This script will run a number of tests to guess values for various
    system dependent variables and detect some quirks of your
    operating system, and finally will create several files in the
    build tree to record what it found.  (You can also run
    <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> in a directory outside the source
    tree if you want to keep the build directory separate.)

    well as all client applications and interfaces that require only a

         This means that you can run the programs through a debugger
         to analyze problems. This enlarges the size of the installed
         executables considerably, and on non-GCC compilers it usually
         also disables compiler optimization, causing slowdowns. However,
         having the symbols available is extremely helpful for dealing
         with any problems that may arise.  Currently, this option is
         recommended for production installations only if you use GCC.

         Also, having the tests turned on won't necessarily enhance the
         stability of your server!  The assertion checks are not categorized
         for severity, and so what might be a relatively harmless bug will
         still lead to server restarts if it triggers an assertion
         failure.  Currently, this option is not recommended for
         production use, but you should have it on for development work
         or when running a beta version.
