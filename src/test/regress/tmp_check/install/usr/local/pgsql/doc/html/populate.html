    <SPAN

    each row that is added.  An additional benefit of doing all
    insertions in one transaction is that if the insertion of one row

    ensures that the planner has up-to-date statistics about the

    load data before creating indexes and foreign keys.  So in this case
    the first several guidelines are handled automatically.  What is left
    for you to do is to set appropriate (i.e., larger than normal) values
    for <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>maintenance_work_mem</TT

    <TT

   </P

    drop or recreate indexes, and it does not normally touch foreign

    So when loading a data-only dump, it is up to you to drop and recreate
    indexes and foreign keys if you wish to use those techniques.
    It's still useful to increase <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>checkpoint_segments</TT
>
    while loading the data, but don't bother increasing
    <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>maintenance_work_mem</TT
>; rather, you'd do that while
    manually recreating indexes and foreign keys afterwards.
    And don't forget to <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ANALYZE</TT
> when you're done.
