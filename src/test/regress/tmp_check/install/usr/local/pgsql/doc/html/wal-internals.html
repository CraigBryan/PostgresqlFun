   required from the administrator except ensuring that the
   disk-space requirements for the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"

   and that any necessary tuning is done (see <A
HREF="wal-configuration.html"

>   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> logs are stored in the directory
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog</TT
> under the data directory, as a set of
   segment files, normally each 16 MB in size.  Each segment is divided into
   pages, normally 8 KB each.  The log record headers are described in
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>access/xlog.h</TT
>; the record content is dependent
   on the type of event that is being logged.  Segment files are given
   ever-increasing numbers as names, starting at
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>000000010000000000000000</TT
>.  The numbers do not wrap, at
   present, but it should take a very very long time to exhaust the
   available stock of numbers.
  </P

>   It is of advantage if the log is located on another disk than the
   main database files.  This may be achieved by moving the directory
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_xlog</TT
> to another location (while the server
   is shut down, of course) and creating a symbolic link from the
   original location in the main data directory to the new location.
  </P
><P
>   The aim of <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
>, to ensure that the log is
   written before database records are altered, may be subverted by
   disk drives<A
NAME="AEN24333"
></A
> that falsely report a
   successful write to the kernel, 
   when in fact they have only cached the data and not yet stored it
   on the disk.  A power failure in such a situation may still lead to
   irrecoverable data corruption.  Administrators should try to ensure
   that disks holding <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
>'s
   <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</ACRONYM
> log files do not make such false reports.
  </P
><P
>   After a checkpoint has been made and the log flushed, the
   checkpoint's position is saved in the file
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
>. Therefore, when recovery is to be
   done, the server first reads <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> and
   then the checkpoint record; then it performs the REDO operation by
   scanning forward from the log position indicated in the checkpoint
   record.  Because the entire content of data pages is saved in the
   log on the first page modification after a checkpoint, all pages
   changed since the checkpoint will be restored to a consistent
   state.
  </P
><P
>   To deal with the case where <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> is
   corrupted, we should support the possibility of scanning existing log
   segments in reverse order &mdash; newest to oldest &mdash; in order to find the
   latest checkpoint.  This has not been implemented yet.
   <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> is small enough (less than one disk page)
   that it is not subject to partial-write problems, and as of this writing
   there have been no reports of database failures due solely to inability
   to read <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> itself.  So while it is
   theoretically a weak spot, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>pg_control</TT
> does not
   seem to be a problem in practice.
