        equivalent), less a safety margin of a megabyte or so.  The safety

        such as expression evaluation.  Setting the parameter higher than
        the actual kernel limit will mean that a runaway recursive function
        can crash an individual backend process.  The default setting is
        2048 KB (two megabytes), which is conservatively small and unlikely
