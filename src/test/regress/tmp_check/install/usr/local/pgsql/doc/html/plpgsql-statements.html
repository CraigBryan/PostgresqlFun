    types that are explicitly understood by
    <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"

    Anything not recognized as one of these statement types is presumed
    to be an SQL command and is sent to the main database engine to execute
    (after substitution of any <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> variables
    used in the statement).  Thus,
    for example, the SQL commands <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT

CLASS="COMMAND"
>UPDATE</TT
>, and
    <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DELETE</TT

     As explained above, the expression in such a statement is evaluated
     by means of an SQL <TT

     database engine.  The expression must yield a single value.
    </P

     data type, or the variable has a specific size/precision
     (like <TT

     converted by the <SPAN

     the result type's output-function and 
     the variable type's input-function. Note that this could potentially

     An example (this assumes that you are using dollar quoting for the
     function as a whole, so the quote marks need not be doubled):
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"

     expressions containing column and table identifiers should be

     It would be a very bad idea to try to do the above example as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)

     happened to contain <TT

     apply to any other dollar-quoting delimiter you might pick.
     So, to safely quote text that is not known in advance, you
     <SPAN
