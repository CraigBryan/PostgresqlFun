      The <ACRONYM

>GNU</ACRONYM
> <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Readline</SPAN
> library (for
      comfortable line editing and command history retrieval) will be
      used by default.  If you don't want to use it then you must
      specify the <TT
CLASS="OPTION"

      <TT

      The <SPAN

      Additional software is needed to build
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> on <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>.
      You can build <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> for
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>NT</SPAN
>-based versions of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>
      (like Windows XP and 2003) using <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>MinGW</SPAN
>;
      see <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>doc/FAQ_MINGW</TT
> for details.  You can also build
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> using
      <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Cygwin</SPAN
>; see <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>doc/FAQ_CYGWIN</TT
>.
      A <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Cygwin</SPAN
>-based build will work on older
      versions of <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>, but if you have a choice,
      we recommend the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>MinGW</SPAN
> approach.
      While these are the only tool sets recommended for a complete build,
      it is possible to build just the C client library
      (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libpq</SPAN
>) and the interactive terminal
      (<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>psql</SPAN
>) using other <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Windows</SPAN
>
      tool sets.  For details of that see
       <A
HREF="install-win32.html"
>Chapter 15</A
>.

      installed Perl at your site.

      like this will appear during the build to point out this fact:
